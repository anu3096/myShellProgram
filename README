BRIEF REPORT:
My shell algorithm is an attempt to imitate the bash terminal
on linux and unix. It waits for the user to enter any bash commands
and also some additional commands such as add 1 2 3 will calculate 
and display the total, muls 1 2 3 will calculate and display the product,
and args “argument,1” 2 3 four will calculate the number of arguments 
and print the arguments that were given. It also checks to see if the 
user enters either < or > to indicate the program to redirect the output
or input from a file. I assumed that redirecting from an input file will only be
performed for certain bash commands like “sort” and “cat” because of the thought
that typing ls < filename will be more work for the user compared to typing ls -al.
The steps on how compile and execute my program are all listed below.

Made for and tested on Linux & Unix systems.

[Shell program terminated]

****************************************

LIMITATIONS:
- was not able to implement:
(4. A command, with or without arguments, executed in the background using &.)
because I did not understand how background processing works with commands.

- also was not able to implement input redirected from a file for some commands.
commands that I know of such as (sort < filename) and (cat < filename) works with
my program but commands like (ls < filename) or (add < filename) or (args < filename)
do not work with my program.
